# Template for Reproducible Research Papers

This repository provides a template for Python code that is accompanying a
research paper.
Most likely, this will be an implementation of an algorithm and/or simulation
results.

The code should be made publicly accessible in order to allow everybody to
reproduce the results presented in the paper.


In this section, you should add information about the paper (title, authors,
journal/conference, DOI, arXiv, ...).
